                <p>Q: What is the FDA doing to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic?</p>

                <p>A: The FDA, along with other federal, state, and local agencies and public health officials across
                    the country and internationally, plays a critical role in protecting public health during the
                    COVID-19 pandemic. FDA staff are working around the clock to support development of medical
                    countermeasures and are providing regulatory advice, guidance, and technical assistance to advance
                    the development and availability of vaccines, therapies, diagnostic tests and other medical devices
                    for use diagnosing, treating, and preventing this novel virus. The FDA continues to monitor the

                <p>A: The best way to prevent COVID-19 is to get vaccinated with an FDA-approved or FDA-authorized

            <div class="question">
                <p>Q: Is hand sanitizer effective against COVID-19?</p>

                <p>A: One of the best ways to prevent the spread of infections and decrease the risk of getting sick is
                    by washing your hands with plain soap and water, advises the CDC. Washing hands often with soap and
                    water for at least 20 seconds is essential, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating;
                    and after coughing, sneezing, or blowing oneâ€™s nose. If soap and water are not available, CDC
                    recommends consumers use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. </p>
